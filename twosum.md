# Two Sum

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Two Sum problem, where given an array of integers and a target value, the program finds the indices of two numbers in the array that add up to the target.

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, the goal is to find and return the indices of two numbers in the array such that they add up to the target. It is assumed that each input has exactly one solution, and the same element cannot be used twice.

## Example

**Example 1:**
```python
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
output = [0, 1]
Example 2:

nums = [3, 2, 4]
target = 6
output = [1, 2]
Example 3:

nums = [3, 3]
target = 6
output = [0, 1]
Implementation
The solution is implemented in Python and uses a hash table (dictionary) to achieve a time complexity less than O(n^2). The two_sum function takes an array nums and a target value target as input and returns the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.

from two_sum import two_sum

nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
result = two_sum(nums, target)
print(result)  # Output: [0, 1]


nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
result = two_sum(nums, target)
print(result)  # Output: [0, 1]
Constraints
2 <= len(nums) <= 10^4
-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
-10^9 <= target <= 10^9
Only one valid answer exists.
Follow-up
The algorithm achieves a time complexity of O(n) by utilizing a hash table. No further optimizations are necessary for this specific problem.
